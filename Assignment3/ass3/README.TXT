Sorry because I am under quarantine right now so it is very hard for me to access mimi
and other internet resources, I apologize for any inconveniences I brought to you.

I used mimi.cs.mcgill.ca.
The testfile.txt I used is the one given in myCourses.

1. To compile the program by bash, type    ./run.sh

2. To run the program, type    ./mykernel

3. To run the program with testfile, type    ./mykernel < testfile.txt
